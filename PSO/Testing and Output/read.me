## Testing and Output

Welcome to the testing and output folder of our Weapon and Control repository! This folder contains test scripts and generated outputs used in testing our software projects. Here, you'll find resources related to quality assurance and testing efforts.

## Purpose

The testing and output stored here serve several important purposes:

- **Quality Assurance**: The test scripts help ensure that our software meets the specified requirements, functions correctly, and remains stable across different environments.

- **Regression Testing**: By storing generated outputs, we can perform regression testing to verify that recent changes have not introduced new bugs or issues.

- **Debugging**: The output files provide valuable insights into the behavior of our software during testing, aiding in debugging and troubleshooting efforts.

## Structure

This folder is divided into two main subdirectories:

### Tests (/tests)

- **/unit**: Contains unit test scripts focusing on testing individual units or components of our software in isolation.
  
- **/integration**: Includes integration test scripts that verify the interactions between different components or modules of our software.
  
- **/end-to-end**: Holds end-to-end test scripts simulating real user scenarios or workflows to validate the overall functionality of our applications.

### Output (/output)

- **/logs**: Stores log files generated during testing, capturing important information such as error messages, warnings, and debug output.
  
- **/reports**: Contains test reports summarizing the results of our testing efforts, including pass/fail statuses, coverage metrics, and performance benchmarks.
  
- **/screenshots**: Includes screenshots or screen recordings capturing the visual output of our applications during testing, useful for visual regression testing.

## How to Contribute

We encourage all team members to contribute to our testing and output repository by following these guidelines:

1. **Test Coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage by writing tests for critical functionality, edge cases, and error handling scenarios.

2. **Automation**: Automate test execution wherever possible to streamline the testing process and facilitate continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

3. **Documentation**: Document test cases, test scenarios, and testing procedures to guide team members and ensure consistency in testing practices.

4. **Feedback**: Provide feedback on test results, identify areas for improvement, and suggest enhancements to our testing infrastructure and methodologies.
