# Source Code

Welcome to the source code folder of our Weapon and Control  repository! This folder contains the source code files for our software projects. Here, you'll find the core logic, implementation details, and modules that power our applications.

## Purpose

The source code stored here serves as the backbone of our software projects, enabling us to build, deploy, and maintain robust and efficient solutions. This folder plays a crucial role in our development process and collaboration efforts.

## Structure

This folder is organized into subdirectories based on the structure of our software projects or the programming languages/frameworks used. Here's an overview of the directory structure:

- **/app**: Contains the main application code files, including entry points, controllers, and models.
  
- **/config**: Stores configuration files, settings, and environment variables used by our applications.
  
- **/lib**: Includes reusable libraries, modules, or utility functions shared across multiple parts of our projects.
  
- **/tests**: Holds unit tests, integration tests, and test fixtures to ensure the quality and reliability of our code.
  
- **/scripts**: Includes scripts for automation, deployment, or other tasks related to our development workflow.
  
- **/docs**: Optionally, this folder can include inline documentation, code comments, or README files specific to the source code.
